In coordination with Earthcube, the AMGeO team hosted a workshop in May 2022 to 
expose current/new AMGeO users to new functionality introduced, as well as applications
of AMGeO data with other geospace tools.

I led workshop in addition to other AMGeO team members: Liam Kilcommons, Tomoko Matsuo and Akash Ratheesh.
We had support from Nicholas Bartel, and Earthcube team members.

## Pre-workshop

Before the workshop, I put together materials for attendees to refresh/learn about Python and 
specific packages used by AMGeO (Xarray, Cartopy, ...)

These materials can be found here: https://amgeo-collaboration.github.io/Earthcube-Workshop-2022-Intro/

## Workshop

During the workshop, we prepared multiple materials for attendees to discuss about, or work on.

I primarily worked on materials for attendees to work on related to AMGeO's new API.
