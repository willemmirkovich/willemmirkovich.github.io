# Predictive Models of Ionospheric Convection Patterns During Substorms Related to STEVE

![AGU Logo](/img/agu-logo.png)

While working as a Professional Research Assistant, I continued my Machine Learning work
and applied some of the things I learned during my AGU 2020 presentation to work I completed with
Tomoko Matsuo and Valerie Svaldi.

## Abstract

The mysterious subauroral phenomenon STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement) was discovered in 2016 by citizen observers, yet its physical mechanism isnâ€™t completely understood.

Assimilative Mapping of Geospace Observations (AMGeO) has enabled further analysis of STEVE events by providing global maps of high-latitude electrodynamic features for 32 STEVE and 32 non-STEVE substorm events.

Global modes of ionospheric convection variability have been identified using principal component analysis of AMGeO maps for both categories of events. The largest difference manifests as the Principal Component 3 (PC3) that represents a pronounced westward extension of the dawn cell into the pre-midnight sector. Specifically, the amplitude of PC3 coefficients appears to anti-correlate the AL index with some time lag.

Using recurrent neural networks, constructed utilizing Long-Short-Term-Memory architecture and hyperparameter optimization techniques, a predictive model of the global convection patterns with respect to the AL index time series is being developed for both STEVE and non-STEVE substorm events. This study will help better understand how global ionospheric electrodynamics evolves through different phases of substorms with or without STEVE.
