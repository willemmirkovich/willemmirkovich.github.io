During the CEDAR 2021 conference, AMGeO led a workhop. This workhop taught AMGeO users how to use AMGeO 
interactively on the Jupyter notebook environment via a web browser for different use case scenarios

I led workshop in addition to other AMGeO team members: Liam Kilcommons, Tomoko Matsuo.
We had support from Nicholas Bartel, Jason Li. 

Special thanks to Andrew Monaghan, who gave us support for running an AWS instance during the workshop.
