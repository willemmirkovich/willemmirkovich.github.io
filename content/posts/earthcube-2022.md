# AMGeO 2.0: Crafting an API for Geospace Data Scientists

![Earthcube Logo](/img/earthcube-logo.png)

While working on the workshop we (AMGeO) hosted in collaboration with Earthcube, I submitted a notebook
building off of the workshop materials and submitted it to Earthcube's 2022 conference. 
This notebook was accepted and published alongside other notebooks presented at the conference.

## Abstract

The Assimilative Mapping of Geospace Observations (AMGeO) is a data science tool for the geospace science community that automates labor-intensive data acquisition and processing, combining observations from various sensors into assimilative maps of the high-latitude ionosphere. While AMGeO offers a highly configurable toolset, it currently requires both domain expertise and familiarity with Python to use it effectively for scientific research.

To remove hurdles for novice users and empower all AMGeO users, we have recently introduced a new Application Programming Interface (API) focused on enhanced user-experience, including better compatibility with Jupyter Notebooks, improved data manipulation with Xarray and more flexible data generation. This notebook will demonstrate the functionality offered by the new API and how to use AMGeO in conjunction with other popular Python research tools in order to accelerate geospace data science processes.
