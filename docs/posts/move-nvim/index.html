I am maintaining my full development .config on github, so feel free to check it out:
https://github.com/willemmirkovich/.config
Intro
After experimenting with it for many months throughout 2023,
I have finally moved almost all of my professional/personal
development to neovim.
When I initially started out with neovim, I initially set things
up with an out of the box setup provided by another developer.
While this was helpful at first, it was based on what they needed
for development, not myself. So many plugins that I was configuring
either didn&rsquo;t make a ton of sense to me at first or were a bit overkill.
This led me to not really learning how the init.lua file was set, or
being bogged down by the shear weight of the setup."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/move-nvim/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://willemmirkovich.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://willemmirkovich.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://willemmirkovich.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://willemmirkovich.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://willemmirkovich.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/move-nvim/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/move-nvim/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Willem Mirkovich"><meta property="og:title" content="Move to Neovim as my editor"><meta property="og:description" content="My Full Setup I am maintaining my full development .config on github, so feel free to check it out: https://github.com/willemmirkovich/.config
