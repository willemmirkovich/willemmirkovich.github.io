[{"content":"Spoiler Alert This was originally a jupyter notebook!\nWhile taking a recent Machine Learning course for my masters, I had the idea of how nice it would be if I did a cool notebook to be able to post it to my personal blog with almost no work involved.\nAnd, to my pleasant suprise, it was pretty simple! Here are the steps to get there:\nWhat you can render Code blocks // this is some javascript var x = 5; console.log(x); # now some python for el in l: print(el) Run actual code with outputs import numpy as np x = np.array([ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], ]) x array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) import pandas as pd # NOTE: need to set this option, or table renders # come out wonky when coverting to markdown pd.set_option(\u0026#39;display.notebook_repr_html\u0026#39;, False) rows = [ { \u0026#39;column_1\u0026#39;: 1, \u0026#39;column_2\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;yippee\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;column_3\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;test\u0026#39;: 10} }, { \u0026#39;column_1\u0026#39;: 2, \u0026#39;column_2\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;nope\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;column_3\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;working?\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;maybe...\u0026#39;} }, ] df = pd.DataFrame(rows) df column_1 column_2 column_3 0 1 yippee {'test': 10} 1 2 nope {'working?': 'maybe...'} import matplotlib.pyplot as plt fig, ax = plt.subplots() x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) y = x ** 2 ax.plot(x, y, color=\u0026#39;green\u0026#39;) ax.set_title(\u0026#39;my plot\u0026#39;) None Latex This is an inline equation: $f(x) = mx + b$\nA fancy inline summation: $\\sum^n_i(x_i^2)$\nAnd new line equations $$f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * x_1 + \\beta_2 * x_2$$\nHow to get the same functionality The following steps should be able to be applied to most statically rendered websites\nStep 1: Have Katex Support If you are using a static site generator, such as hugo, all of your websites posts will be some sort of .md file. Since most of the notebooks I work with for classes make use of Latex equations, having this work out of the box is super important for me.\nLuckily, Katex has awesome auto-rendering capabilities that come out of the box. To use these on your own site, look to the Auto-render Extension:Usage docs.\nOut of the box, rendering is only supported for $$ delimiters, and will render these on their own line. So, to get inline latex, you need to add the $ delimiter option.

For this use case, the markdown format is what we want:\njupyter nbconvert --to markdown [notebook].ipynb Once done, you will get a nice [notebook].md file, along with [notebook]_files directory with any static images you generated (such as plots).\nNow that you have both of these, only thing necessary to do is copy these over to your site generator and test them out!\nSome additonal things you may need to do:\nIf using hugo, you may need to add a post header to the top of the markdown file, like: --- title: \u0026#34;Who needs titles\u0026#34; date: 2024-01-25T13:16:30-05:00 draft: false --- To get static file generation working, I needed to move the [notebook]_files to my static directory for my site. In addition to this, I also modified the relative link for plots in the [notebook].md file to site links, like so: **before** ![png](notebook_files/notebook_4_0.png) **after** ![png](/notebook_files/notebook_4_0.png) Voila You can now use these combined tools to easily render jupyter notebooks to your static site!\nOnly steps I am thinking of improving is making this into a full blown script, but that is work for another night\n","permalink":"https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/render_notebook/","summary":"Spoiler Alert This was originally a jupyter notebook!\nWhile taking a recent Machine Learning course for my masters, I had the idea of how nice it would be if I did a cool notebook to be able to post it to my personal blog with almost no work involved.\nAnd, to my pleasant suprise, it was pretty simple!

While this was helpful at first, it was based on what they needed for development, not myself. So many plugins that I was configuring either didn\u0026rsquo;t make a ton of sense to me at first or were a bit overkill. This led me to not really learning how the init.lua file was set, or being bogged down by the shear weight of the setup.\nSuccessful move to Neovim On my second go around, I took a different approach and went bottom up on my own. This allowed me to practice the basics of vim again, and think about the biggest things I needed from my editor, which are:\nsyntax highlighting smart autocomplete suggestions quick code traversal (goto definition, search) auto-formatting Once I knew what I needed, I was able to search for plugins, and add them iteratively. Adding them one by one proved really helpful, I could learn about their uses individually without having everything all at once and not connecting which plugin was doing what.\nIn addition to neovim, I have also moved to using tmux and alacritty, awesome projects that have brought my setup all together. Now that I am at a \u0026lsquo;version 1\u0026rsquo;, I feel my development has increased signifigantly, mostly due to some amazing individual plugins/packages:\ntelescope needs no introduction, find files/references throughout your repos in seconds mason-lspconfig enables quick and easy setup of all the major lsp packages you will want for languages nvim-treesitter for great syntax highlighting as well as other features I have yet to really dig into nvim-tmux-navigator for seamless transitioning between panes/buffers between nvim \u0026amp; tmux Future Improvements Here are some of the things I would like to do with my setup in the future:\nsplit up my init.lua file, as it is currently a little bloated find a good way to use jupyter notebooks with this setup, as I still use vscode for this currently :( ","permalink":"https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/move-nvim/","summary":"My Full Setup I am maintaining my full development .config on github, so feel free to check it out: https://github.com/willemmirkovich/.config\nIntro After experimenting with it for many months throughout 2023, I have finally moved almost all of my professional/personal development to neovim.\nWhen I initially started out with neovim, I initially set things up with an out of the box setup provided by another developer.

While AMGeO offers a highly configurable toolset, it currently requires both domain expertise and familiarity with Python to use it effectively for scientific research.\nTo remove hurdles for novice users and empower all AMGeO users, we have recently introduced a new Application Programming Interface (API) focused on enhanced user-experience, including better compatibility with Jupyter Notebooks, improved data manipulation with Xarray and more flexible data generation. This notebook will demonstrate the functionality offered by the new API and how to use AMGeO in conjunction with other popular Python research tools in order to accelerate geospace data science processes.\nAuthors Willem Mirkovich, Tomoko Matsuo, Liam Kilcommons\n","permalink":"https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/earthcube-2022/","summary":"AMGeO 2.0: Crafting an API for Geospace Data Scientists While working on the workshop we (AMGeO) hosted in collaboration with Earthcube, I submitted a notebook building off of the workshop materials and submitted it to Earthcube\u0026rsquo;s 2022 conference.

The largest difference manifests as the Principal Component 3 (PC3) that represents a pronounced westward extension of the dawn cell into the pre-midnight sector. Specifically, the amplitude of PC3 coefficients appears to anti-correlate the AL index with some time lag.\nUsing recurrent neural networks, constructed utilizing Long-Short-Term-Memory architecture and hyperparameter optimization techniques, a predictive model of the global convection patterns with respect to the AL index time series is being developed for both STEVE and non-STEVE substorm events.

Fusing data from multiple measurement sources and creating more accurate, consistent, and complete descriptions of electrodynamics for research in this area is incredibly important, yet a classically difficult task. One of the main issues is the constantly changing state of the ionospheric electrodynamics. The recently developed AMGeO (Assimilative Mapping of Geospace Observations) open-source software utilizes a Bayesian inferential framework to solve the spatial prediction problem posed by the need to fill the gaps left in sparsely and irregularly sampled data. AMGeO offers a robust approximation to this inferential problem and produces snapshot maps of polar ionospheric electrodynamics states.\nThis paper aims to expand the scope of the Bayesian inferential problem solved in AMGeO to a spatiotemporal prediction problem. Solving the spatiotemporal problem will require a state transition model that takes a current state and predicts a state at a future time step. The state transition model is being learned from large volumes of AMGeO maps using Convolutional Neural Networks. The improvements gained by this expansion will be evaluated on various performance metrics.\nAuthors Willem Mirkovich, Tomoko Matsuo, Liam Killcommons\n","permalink":"https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/agu-2020/","summary":"Data-Driven Modeling of Polar Ionospheric Electrodynamics Using Convolutional Neural Networks After my graduation in 2020, I presented some of the work I did while working with Tomoko Matsuo my senior year.\nPoster AGU 2021 Poster\nAbstract Polar ionospheric electrodynamics are an integral part of understanding the Sun to Earth connection.
