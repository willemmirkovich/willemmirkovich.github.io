While this was helpful at first, it was based on what they needed for development, not myself. So many plugins that I was configuring either didn\u0026rsquo;t make a ton of sense to me at first or were a bit overkill. This led me to not really learning how the init.lua file was set, or being bogged down by the shear weight of the setup.\nSuccessful move to Neovim On my second go around, I took a different approach and went bottom up on my own. This allowed me to practice the basics of vim again, and think about the biggest things I needed from my editor, which are:\nsyntax highlighting smart autocomplete suggestions quick code traversal (goto definition, search) auto-formatting Once I knew what I needed, I was able to search for plugins, and add them iteratively. Adding them one by one proved really helpful, I could learn about their uses individually without having everything all at once and not connecting which plugin was doing what.\nIn addition to neovim, I have also moved to using tmux and alacritty, awesome projects that have brought my setup all together. Now that I am at a \u0026lsquo;version 1\u0026rsquo;, I feel my development has increased signifigantly, mostly due to some amazing individual plugins/packages:\ntelescope needs no introduction, find files/references throughout your repos in seconds mason-lspconfig enables quick and easy setup of all the major lsp packages you will want for languages nvim-treesitter for great syntax highlighting as well as other features I have yet to really dig into nvim-tmux-navigator for seamless transitioning between panes/buffers between nvim \u0026amp; tmux Future Improvements Here are some of the things I would like to do with my setup in the future:\nsplit up my init.lua file, as it is currently a little bloated find a good way to use jupyter notebooks with this setup, as I still use vscode for this currently :( ","permalink":"https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/move-nvim/","summary":"My Full Setup I am maintaining my full development .config on github, so feel free to check it out: https://github.com/willemmirkovich/.config\nIntro After experimenting with it for many months throughout 2023, I have finally moved almost all of my professional/personal development to neovim.\nWhen I initially started out with neovim, I initially set things up with an out of the box setup provided by another developer.

While AMGeO offers a highly configurable toolset, it currently requires both domain expertise and familiarity with Python to use it effectively for scientific research.\nTo remove hurdles for novice users and empower all AMGeO users, we have recently introduced a new Application Programming Interface (API) focused on enhanced user-experience, including better compatibility with Jupyter Notebooks, improved data manipulation with Xarray and more flexible data generation. This notebook will demonstrate the functionality offered by the new API and how to use AMGeO in conjunction with other popular Python research tools in order to accelerate geospace data science processes.\nAuthors Willem Mirkovich, Tomoko Matsuo, Liam Kilcommons\n","permalink":"https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/earthcube-2022/","summary":"AMGeO 2.0: Crafting an API for Geospace Data Scientists While working on the workshop we (AMGeO) hosted in collaboration with Earthcube, I submitted a notebook building off of the workshop materials and submitted it to Earthcube\u0026rsquo;s 2022 conference.

The largest difference manifests as the Principal Component 3 (PC3) that represents a pronounced westward extension of the dawn cell into the pre-midnight sector. Specifically, the amplitude of PC3 coefficients appears to anti-correlate the AL index with some time lag.\nUsing recurrent neural networks, constructed utilizing Long-Short-Term-Memory architecture and hyperparameter optimization techniques, a predictive model of the global convection patterns with respect to the AL index time series is being developed for both STEVE and non-STEVE substorm events. This study will help better understand how global ionospheric electrodynamics evolves through different phases of substorms with or without STEVE.\nAuthors Willem Mirkovich, Tomoko Matsuo, Valerie Svaldi\n","permalink":"https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/agu-2021/","summary":"Predictive Models of Ionospheric Convection Patterns During Substorms Related to STEVE While working as a Professional Research Assistant, I continued my Machine Learning work and applied some of the things I learned during my AGU 2020 presentation to work I completed with Tomoko Matsuo and Valerie Svaldi.\nPresentation All of the work I did for this presentation, in addition to links to my recorded talk and slides can be found in the following repository: AGU-2021","title":"My presentation @ AGU 2021"},{"content":" During the CEDAR 2021 conference, AMGeO led a workhop.

Fusing data from multiple measurement sources and creating more accurate, consistent, and complete descriptions of electrodynamics for research in this area is incredibly important, yet a classically difficult task. One of the main issues is the constantly changing state of the ionospheric electrodynamics. The recently developed AMGeO (Assimilative Mapping of Geospace Observations) open-source software utilizes a Bayesian inferential framework to solve the spatial prediction problem posed by the need to fill the gaps left in sparsely and irregularly sampled data. AMGeO offers a robust approximation to this inferential problem and produces snapshot maps of polar ionospheric electrodynamics states.\nThis paper aims to expand the scope of the Bayesian inferential problem solved in AMGeO to a spatiotemporal prediction problem. Solving the spatiotemporal problem will require a state transition model that takes a current state and predicts a state at a future time step. The state transition model is being learned from large volumes of AMGeO maps using Convolutional Neural Networks. The improvements gained by this expansion will be evaluated on various performance metrics.\nAuthors Willem Mirkovich, Tomoko Matsuo, Liam Killcommons\n","permalink":"https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/agu-2020/","summary":"Data-Driven Modeling of Polar Ionospheric Electrodynamics Using Convolutional Neural Networks After my graduation in 2020, I presented some of the work I did while working with Tomoko Matsuo my senior year.\nPoster AGU 2021 Poster\nAbstract Polar ionospheric electrodynamics are an integral part of understanding the Sun to Earth connection.
