[{"content":"As of late, I have really enjoyed using Jupyter Notebooks for my exploratory programming and data science. While immenesly user friendly in the browser, I have missed some of the following functionality I have come to use in my VSCode IDE:\n auto-complete syntax highlighting import warnings/missing package info  For this reason, I have moved all of my jupyter development to VS Code\u0026rsquo;s Jupyter Environment. This extension comes baked with all the IDE utiliies I am accustomed to\u0026hellip;\nBut, I am missing my Vim keybindings for maniupulating/navigating notebook cells! The great Jupyter Vim binding project has great vim support for editting notebooks in the browser, such as\n y to copy a cell p to paste a cell j/k for navigating up and down  among others.\nSo, to get this same functionality, I have implemented the Juypter Vim Keymap Extension, meant to work alongside the great Vim emulation Extension.\nThis package is very much in its infancy as it currently stands, but includes the following functionality currently:\n j \u0026amp; k for navigating cells down/up respectively y, x \u0026amp; p to copy/cut/paste cells u to undo gg and shift+g to jump to top/bottom cell o and shift+o to open new cell below/above i to edit cell  As stated, this extension is very fresh and needs work to include more vim expected features.\nHope someone gets some use out of this! Hoping to add a lot in the future.\nCheckout the source =\u0026gt; https://github.com/willemmirkovich/vscode-jupyter-keymap-vim\n","permalink":"https://willemmirkovich.github.io/posts/vscode-jupyter-vim-keymap/","summary":"As of late, I have really enjoyed using Jupyter Notebooks for my exploratory programming and data science.
